# Bob's Repository of Bioinformatics Training Knowledge
This respository is simply a collection of links, tutorials, code, presentations, etc. to help students, biologists, or anyone interested in learning basic bioinformatic skills. In all reality, having a basic complement of bionformatic skills is an ___absolute necessity___ to be a successful, productive, and useful biologist in the future.  No matter the field of biology, datasets are getting larger and more complex, along with the tools to process them.  The following is organized into a set of loosely defined "_Modules_" based on what helped me successfully learn these skills as well as teach them.  So, please utilize, share, or critique this collection.  I attempt to update it whenever I have time, and am always welcome to suggestions.  Enjoy!

### Module 1: If you are asking "Why should I even learn this stuff?"
- I recommend you start by reading some of these publications that illustrate the importance of bioinformatics and computational biology
  - __[All biology is computational biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2002050)__ by Florian Markowetz 

### Module 2:  The basics of the Unix Shell and an introduction to the "command line interface" (CLI)
- Introductory traininng tutorials
  - [Another short beginner's tutorial](https://dbsloan.github.io/TS2018/exercises/unix_commands.html)
  - [A good set of tutorials](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/)
  - [Highly recommended tutorials for beginners to novice, complete with graphics](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- Cheat Sheets of Unix Commands!!!!
  - [cheat sheet 1](./pdf/cheatsheet1.pdf)
  - [cheat sheet 2](./pdf/cheatsheet2.pdf)
  - [cheat sheet 3](./pdf/cheatsheet3.pdf)

### Module 3:  Basic program installation.... every bioinformatician's headache!


### Module 4:  Simple processing of genetic data on the CLI


### Module 5:  Working with next-generation sequencing (NGS) data (cleaning, processing, mapping, assembling, etc)


### Module 6:  R
- [R Cheatsheet](./pdf/Rcard.pdf)
  - I used this cheatsheet ___ALL THE TIME___ when I was first learning to use R


### Module 6:  Python
